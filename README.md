Jquery game: "Crystal Hunter"
Version 1.0 -- index.html has the basic game elements (directions score, wins/losses) in place. style.css is filled in for the basic page appearance.  game.js. is still empty. Images added. Reset.css has been populated with the Meyer web reset css.
Version 0.2 -- basic game layout in index.html is mostly complete, still needs the crystal boxes and images added.
style.css if filled in for the basic page appearance. no code for the game written yet. Crystal images added to asserts/images folder. 
Version 0.3 -- crysal object coding started, added favicon to main game page.
Version 0.4 -- crystal object coding completed, starting game-play coding in image click event-handler.
0.5 -- game now accrues crystal points, and can determine a win or loss.
Version 0.6 -- successfully determines win or loss, does not yet restart the game after a win or loss.
Version 0.7 -- game reset after win/loss implemented, but requires debugging. Win/lose sounds added, but do not play successfully.
Version 0.8 -- win/loss implemented and debugged. Win/lose sounds converted to mp3 format, but still do not play.
Version 1.0 -- added an alert message to let user know expilicitly that game has been reset. Worked on variety of methods for playing sounds, they still do not play, even when tested explicitly, not part of game code. I am thinkung this may be a Chrome setting, although I am not getting any error messages in the console. I've done a variety of research on this issue, and not found any answers that work.
Version 1.2 -- testing code removed.
